# ViT-LSTM-Image-Caption-Generation
Hereâ€™s a README for your LSTM-based model, based on the architecture visualization:

## Overview
This repository contains an LSTM-based deep learning model built using TensorFlow/Keras for processing sequential data. The model architecture consists of various layers, including embedding, LSTM, dense, dropout, and regularization layers.

## Model Architecture
The neural network consists of the following layers:

1. **Input Layer** (Yellow) - Accepts the input data.
2. **Embedding Layer** (Purple) - Converts input sequences into dense vector representations.
3. **LSTM Layers** (Dark Blue) - Captures temporal dependencies in sequential data.
4. **Dense Layers** (Teal) - Fully connected layers for feature extraction and output prediction.
5. **Dropout Layers** (Red) - Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping connections during training.
6. **Regularization Layers** (Pink) - Improves generalization and reduces overfitting.

## Installation
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. **Load the dataset:** Ensure your dataset is preprocessed into tokenized sequences.
2. **Train the model:** Run the training script to fit the model to your data.
3. **Evaluate the model:** Assess the performance using validation/test data.
4. **Make predictions:** Use the trained model for sequence prediction tasks.

## Example Code Snippet
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def create_lstm_model(vocab_size, max_length):
    input_layer = Input(shape=(max_length,))
    embedding = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=128)(input_layer)
    lstm = LSTM(256, return_sequences=False)(embedding)
    dropout = Dropout(0.5)(lstm)
    dense = Dense(128, activation='relu')(dropout)
    output_layer = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense)

    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

## Notes
- Adjust `vocab_size` and `max_length` according to your dataset.
- Modify LSTM units and dropout rates for better performance.
- Regularization techniques can be added based on training behavior.

## Future Work
- Implement bidirectional LSTM for better feature extraction.
- Integrate attention mechanisms for better context understanding.
- Tune hyperparameters using KerasTuner.
